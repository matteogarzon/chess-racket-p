### What does the program do?

- This is a chess game that can be played by two players on the same computer.


### How to use the program

The gameplay is straightforward:

- To start moving your own piece, select one of your choice. Dots will show on different squares, indicating on which places the piece can be moved to.
- To make the move, select one of the dots. The piece won’t move if you select any other square!
- You can’t move the opponent’s pieces. Once the opponent moves a pawn, you will see the change on your chessboard.

- To help the player, when moving the King, red dots will show to indicate in which positions the King will be in check afterwards.
- The game ends once the King has been checked.

- To exit the game anytime, press “q”. Scared of pressing it by mistake? No worries, there’ll be a prompt page asking for confirmation (”y” to official ending the game, “n” to resume).
